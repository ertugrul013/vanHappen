We are making this project for the Van Happen Containers company in Eindhoven.
They want a game that draws the attention of young people between the ages of 8 and 14 to the importance of recycling.

>We received a basic concept from fellow students.

## Gameplay

### Player 1
Player 1 runs over a road. There is in the way that the game must collect.
Moreover, there are obstacles that you have to dodge, and monsters that you have to shoot.
You work with hp / lives, so you run into obstacles too often, you go off. But there are also lifetimes to pick up.

### Player 2
Player 2 must separate waste by moving the conveyor belts.
If there is a certain amount of waste in a bin, you earn a power-up.
Depending on the box, this can be for player 1 or 2.
If you separate too much waste into the wrong bin, it will be hidden and you will not be able to put any waste in it.
